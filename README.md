# CraneZone-Lite
CraneZone-Lite is an AI-powered safety monitoring system designed to enhance crane operation safety in construction and industrial environments.
It uses computer vision and deep learning (YOLOv8) to detect, classify, and track hooks, loads, and personnel in real time — ensuring safe crane operations by maintaining a dynamic “safe envelope” around active zones.
